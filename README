Codename Lumberjack is a simple flash game written using Actionscript 3.0 and Flixel.

Play the game here: http://projects.iarke.us/codenamelumberjack/

The game serves as a very basic tutorial for creating a simple adventure platformer in Flixel. It features:
* Generating a world map from a color Bitmap (a future feature of Flixel, currently in the development and beta branches)
* Various environments
* Basic platforming physics and collision
* Coin collecting

It is very feature light in order to provide a lightweight entry into the world of Flixel platformers.

Codename Lumberjack was originally being written as a way for me to delve into the world of FlashBuilder and GitHub, having never touched either of them.
